ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This is one of my first projects to attemt to showcase what I've learned from my first semester as a computer science major.
The goal of this game is to buy gear and challenge various bodybuilders of different ratings
and win in order to beat the game. If the 3 time reigning Mr. Olyympia Chris Bumstead reaches level 50 before you
beat the bosses, you lose the game. I decided to take this approach because the gym is something I'm interested in
and changing the theme is something I can attribute my focus and commitment for this project to. This is just a quick
fun game that I'm proud to have created.
